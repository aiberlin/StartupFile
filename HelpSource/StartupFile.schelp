DESCRIPTION::
StartupFile allows easy switching between multiple startup files,
so one can keep working on different projects.
It writes a text file that redirects to one of the known startup files.
code::
// top level convenience - choose from known startup files:
StartupFile.choose;

// the startupfile that will be loaded next time:
StartupFile.open;
// the available files
StartupFile.fileNames.cs;
// which live here:
StartupFile.filesDir;
StartupFile.openDir;

// the defaultPath is where the system looks for startup file;
// StartupFile writes the redirect startup file there.
StartupFile.defaultPath;
StartupFile.openDefault;

// StartupFile has some examples here:
StartupFile.examplesDir.openOS;

// which get copied automatically into filesDir on startup
StartupFile.filePaths.printcsAll;

// these redirect files need to get overwritten;
// in case a non-redirecting startup file is found there,
/// that file gets copied to the filesDir with a date-and-time stamp:
StartupFile.openDir;

// write a startup file that points to an external file path
// which typically is a project load script:
~externalPath = "~/Desktop/PumpFriction/loadMe.scd";
StartupFile.writeStartupFileToExternalPath('PumpFriction', ~externalPath);
StartupFile.writeRedirectFile('PumpFriction');
// make that file
File.mkdir(~externalPath.dirname.standardizePath);
File.use(~externalPath.standardizePath, "w", { |file|
	file.write("thisProcess.nowExecutingPath.openOS")
});

/// now recompile, and that file should open itself by code:
thisProcess.recompile;
StartupFile.choose;
